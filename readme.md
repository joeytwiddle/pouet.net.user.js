# Pouet.net.user.js

Pouet.net is most likely the best site to find demoscene releases. This is a little collection of user.js that can make it more pleasant.

## AttentionWhores

Unfortunately Pouet.net's oneliner, bbs, and prod pages are crippled with trolls, psychotics, morons and other attention whores.
I started this user.js back in January 2005 to address this. Yes, that code is oooold and it shows :p

### How to use it

* Install the user.js in your browser. Ideally, in your site preferences for pouet.net.
* There should be a big horn in the top left corner of pouet.net.
* Click it to show all the user posts and a tiny horn next to each user.
* Click a tiny horn to toggle the AttentionWhore flag for this user.
* Click again the big horn to hide the post of the AttentionWhore users.

## ytEmbed

The demoscene goes on a wide and wild range of platform that's not available to everyone. Thankfully many demos are captured and uploaded on Youtube. This user.js replaced the screenshot by the embedded Youtube video whenever possible.

## prodScreenshot

Adds the corresponding thumbnail inside each link to a prod. This work on all pages but the index which would get too busy.
Note that it uses multiple background images to try the three most common image formats. Pouet.net uses ETAGs, so the servers should not blink despite this rather brutal approach.

That's all folks
