# Pouet.net.user.js

Pouet.net is most likely the best site to find demoscene releases. Unfortunately its oneliner, bbs, and prod pages are crippled with trolls, psychotics, morons and other attention whores.
I started this user.js back in January 2005 to address this. Yes, that code is oooold and it shows :p

# How to use it

* Install the user.js in your browser. Ideally, in your site preferences for pouet.net.
* There should be a big horn in the top left corner of pouet.net.
* Click it to show all the user posts and a tiny horn next to each user.
* Click a tiny horn to toggle the AttentionWhore flag for this user.
* Click again the big horn to hide the post of the AttentionWhore users.

That's all folks
